    <p><b>september horoscopes ☽</b></p>
      <a onclick="alert('A r i e s ~ I have three ‘S’ words for you this month Aries! Sunken in, Surreal, and Sobering. There’s been much to juggle over this last bit and you may find yourself wanting to shut the world out. Creating four walls however and wherever you can to hold you at this time, will keep you from blending into your surroundings. Pull back to return to yourself. Your attention is being casted to a deeper place. You cannot name joy unless you have experienced it yourself. So, your resolutions to what you are facing are something you have already experienced. Confidence in the newness of an environment vs. confidence in your experience are two different perspectives. Both offer a fresh look. Naivety dressed to look wise.')">aries</a>
      <a onclick="alert('T a u r u s ~ It’s a great time to ask for help if you need, even if it’s just a short phone call or text to a friend. Valuable lessons are being learnt about your drive to create and how you manage the longevity of your relationship with creation. Nothing is permanent and any feelings of being scattered will settle in time. The work you do is not only for you, but also to help others. I think that is so admirable. Don’t rush it though. You need to absorb all the nourishment of this process. Imagine that wherever you are in life, we can still be learning the basic nutrients of that version of ourselves. Drink in the potent calm of the cocoon you are in. A caterpillar and a butterfly have two different guidebooks. We are wise for a moment and then know nothing at all.')">taurus</a>
      <a onclick="alert('G e m i n i ~ You’re not going to be at home much, let me just say that as this horoscopes ice breaker. The motivations you’ve been feeling under the surface finally have a time to play out. This month there will be opportunity to acknowledge any regrets, redemption, and forgiveness. As you integrate broken pieces, listen to the voice that keeps begging for your attention. Crossroads only come up to show you that you have a choice. That you embody choice. If you are considering making big changes in your life, I certainly encourage it! Regardless, daily journaling may help you to see where you are coming from at a given time. Reading/Listening to those passages back in the future will feel like an old friend who knows your inner soul. ')">gemini</a>
      <a onclick="alert('C a n c e r ~ Think of this month as sugary and sweet thoughts being all the sustenance you need to keep going. Like gentle breadcrumbs, with something tangible just around the corner. Having the whole pie right now would be hard to digest. So, breaking things into pieces, generating energy, and not getting too hung up on timing will hopefully put your heart at ease. You are in the process of drawing your arrow backwards. Keeping an open mind to wherever that arrow lands will allow for what you can control. Trust in positive developments and romance. It may be difficult to see where these crumbs lead… But know that you have the skills to dream up the world you would like to live in.')">cancer</a>
      <a onclick="alert('L e o ~ In certain complex situations you often know how to act. However, our minds can easily become overworked. It is rare for us to consider how stimulated we really are. Take some time this month to get to know your core values, again, and then again after that. Notice any reliance on sarcasm to negate any resentments or hidden truths. Being supportive, kind and consistent to yourself will help you to respect your process in the future. Then when you feel ready, define your thoughts and create a plan. It’s okay to take a break too. Deciding not to do anything is still a valid decision. Sometimes it feels like we are just getting by, but please know that our visions and voices are connected beyond what we see. This is the heat that heals.')">leo</a>
      <a onclick="alert('V i r g o ~ Hi Virgo babies ~ a loving season to you, mercurial musings. I’m sensing the end of something that has caused stress or pain for you in the past. Please know that peace and strength is available to all, no matter where you are at. That healing lasts for however long you need so don’t feel like you have to be (x) better in an (x) amount of time. Speaking of needs, it’s best that you take care of yours. Like unbuttoning that top button after a big meal. Instinctual care. This month, going back to the basics of where you are directing your time and energy will signify a new beginning. You are your own living mascot of transformation. Further down the road, use these moments as a marker of how far you have come. Welcome in friendships that allow you to feel present and still.')">virgo</a>
      <a onclick="alert('L i b r a ~ You recognize that your own needs are not cut off from those of others. At the same time, you aren’t looking for others to congratulate you before moving forward. I love this for you, as it seems you are trusting and seeing your own magnitude and that feels incredibly secure. You have the power to get what you want through the strength of your mind and force of your will. Don’t hesitate to ask for help along the way. This is a good month to explore magical helpers such as…But not limited to… Tarot, intentionally anointing yourself with your fav scent, caring for plants, or even the way you stir your coffee. (Clockwise to bring something into your life, counter-clockwise to let go.) Count on some vivid dreams, your desire being strong. Right now, preparing for the future is being in the present moment.')">libra</a>
      <a onclick="alert('S c o r p i o ~ There are areas of your life that seem to be competing for your time. If you can, try not to focus on events unresolved. You can’t feel balanced all of the time and that’s okay. The best thing you can do at this time is to come clean about how you feel so that everyone can heal. You’ve always known about your presence being the catalyst for change and regeneration. Honesty and forgiveness will help you to stop looking outside of yourself for the answers. Wanting to flip to other pages in your life’s book I think is natural. Maybe the adventure or suspense you are craving begins when you fall asleep from the waking world. Pay attention to those dreams right now. Take whatever time you need to think, reflect, to belong. Soon the question of “what are you trying to tell me???” Will turn into “Wow, I knew this all along.”')">scorpio</a>
      <a onclick="alert('S a g i t t a r i u s ~ Decisions between what is familiar and the unknown. Take a step back, specifically on a mental plane if you can, to remind yourself why you do the things that you do. Within you is a well of endless energy. This doesn’t mean you always have to funnel that energy into something linear. Obviously easier said than done. Respect your own personal process. I am here to gently remind you that every moment is worth savouring, sometimes twice. Go back and revise wherever you feel necessary. This month is meant to show you which outside pressures make it difficult to remember your original purpose. Check in. Keep it simple. You got this!')">sagittarius</a>
      <a onclick="alert('C a p r i c o r n ~ I feel as though you want to be seen by someone or something, yet at the same time deny the pleasure of it. Why is that? Maybe you have felt you were being pulled in two different directions or that small disagreements felt like strong insults. Relationships are meant to break down the walls of what we think we can control. Over time, you have gathered the information to decide on something with your full heart and trust. You’ve been letting this opportunity ripen and baby, it’s about to be harvest time. Whatever or whoever you are considering, you are sprouting from mutual love. It will soon feel like every part of your world is working in accordance with your movement. How you interact with these situations will show you more of who you are.')">capricorn</a>
      <a onclick="alert('A q u a r i u s ~ I think we all dislike being put into a box, especially you Aquarius. Exciting life transitions are wanting to make themselves available to you. Take to the idea that some moments preserve themselves. An enclosed space of juicy and worthwhile immersion is not a box. You are supported from all sides. There is no intention of tying you in, in fact the opposite. You are letting go of any binds this month, becoming aware of your limiting thought patterns and loosening the grip of self-judgement. This may be from the aftermath of a conflict. There is a current of meaningful and enduring relationships present or coming for you. Feelings bottle up when we continue whining at doors already closed. Look to new love and ideas that come from the heart. Facing yourself has been the antidote to your own liberation.')">aquarius</a>
      <a onclick="alert('P i s c e s ~ You’ve grown tired of the things that you know. Something has changed and it is altering your reality for the better. Maybe you have gotten more in touch with the root of yourself. The place where compassion begins and extends outwards. You are in the process of moving on from what you were unsatisfied with. Let what you see and feel be said, the force of your ideas demand to be expressed. This doesn’t have to be verbal either. Whatever your comfortability, or modality. It’s not about who hears them, more so it’s about You giving yourself a chance. The last few months have been a gathering of tools to help you navigate stress to, with time, come out the other side. You know how people harness superhuman strength in situations where their adrenaline kicks in? This month, in your own way, that is YOU.')">pisces</a>
