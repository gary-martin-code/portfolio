A formal presentation?<br>
A network mixer?<br>
An ideas generation session?<br>
A messy planning meeting with post-its everywhere?<br>

Speaking in a video call puts you in the spotlight.<br>

Large group calls can be overwhelming,<br>

Have a maximum of 6 people in a video call.<br>

When people join:<br>
Have music playing to keep it casual.<br>
Or wave and cheer to make it special.<br><br>

Before leaving:<br>
Replicate 3D space and move out of sight.<br>
Or plan a 10 second silence and leave together.<br><br>

Too much sound can cause distortion and confusion. <br>
Why not develop your own visual cues<br>
or signs of appreciation.<br><br>

Check in and make sure your links aren‚Äôt out of date.<br>
Is that site still there? Has that video been taken down?<br>
Expired links should go in the compost and be replaced with fresh ones.<br><br>

we move away from shelves and cupboards to files and folders.<br><br>

Sketchbooks, scraps and glue stick.<br><br>

Don‚Äôt be so precious about your digital spaces all the time.<br>
