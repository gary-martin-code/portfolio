                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I am an artist, researcher and educator based in Cardiff, whose work explores systems of consumption and creation, and human-technology relationships.</p>

                <h2>Now</h2>
                <p> I've just released a single called <a href="https://jackofthesuburbs.bandcamp.com/track/pacemaker" style="text-decoration:underline;">'Pacemaker'</a>  as Jack of the Suburbs, my solo music project.</p>
<p>Over the winter I began playing chess on the chess.com app. It's highly addictave and am enjoying playing 10 minute matches.</p>    
<p>I'm looking to buy a van to refurbish so my partner and I can take trips around Wales. I also want to be able to make music away from home so will use it as a portable studio.</p>
<p>I'm about to complete my MA in Creative Music Practice that I started in September 2019.</p>

                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <p>I recently set up a cooperative record label, called <a href="https://thirdnature.world" target="self">Third Nature Recordings</a>, to explore more equitable systems for music makers.</p>
<p>Along with Jack Rees and Leigh Davies, I'm working on making music with inherited cassette tapes as the <a href="http://geocities.ws/thecoin/LLTA" target="self">Llandovery Tape Archive</a>.</p>
<p>I recently carried out a research project on music making practices on internet platforms which culminated in a paper called <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQ3LSNa7K8biQUZBqxiKUjOva2iZhn6eRQM7Yod3cpzKfpAmnGSAhLQZm2NWGxBkQ/pub" target="self">Platform Determinism</a>.</p>
<p>I am in the process of publishing a digital/physical zine called <a href="/interfacing/" style="text-decoration:underline;">Interfacing</a>, about how to work together while being apart, as part of a collaboration with Site Sit on their <a href="https://www.kultivera.nu/pluggedin" style="text-decoration:underline;">Plugged In</a> project.</p>
<p>During the summer of 2020 I started a virtual performance project called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTgKnafEt8M" target="self">Cul-De-Sac Festival</a>, designed to encourage artists to consider how the platforms on which they share their work inform the work itself.</p>
